Ensure Linux and Windows compiles do not share the same directory as files may be incompatible.
##aoc: Cached files in /scratch/FPGA may be used to reduce compilation time
##aoc: Compiling for FPGA. This process may take several hours to complete.  Prior to performing this compile, be sure to check the reports to ensure the design will meet your performance targets.  If the reports indicate performance targets are not being met, code edits may be required.  Please refer to the Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL Best Practices Guide for information on performance tuning applications for FPGAs.
